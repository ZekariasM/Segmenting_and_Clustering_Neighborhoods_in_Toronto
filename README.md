# Segmenting and Clustering Neighborhoods in Toronto

In this assignment, we will explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto using simple pandas code to scrap a [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M). The Wikipedia page comprises three tables, and we analyze the first table that contains the Postal Code,  Borough, and Neighbourhood.
